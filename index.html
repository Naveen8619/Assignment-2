						  	<p>My name is Naveen Satish Kumar, I am an Australian-born Indian, and a proud RMIT student. I completed VCE in 2020 and am now studying Information Technology at RMIT. I enjoy playing and watching basketball and gaming on the PS5. I have an interest in cars and thoroughly enjoy driving them now that I have my license. Finally, I am a HUGE fan of Marvel and the US (United States) version of The Office. In terms of my interest in IT, my interest and passion for technology grew larger and larger, similar to the amount of money my parents invested into this “passion”. My broad end goal would be to utilize technology's potential to improve the world we live in, whether it be helping small businesses or working for the government. Currently my IT skills are quite simple, however I do now have some basic skills in python, SQL, HTML and CSS.</p>

							<p>My name is Nivain Perera, I am 18 years old, I was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Australia in 2012. I previously studied at Mount Waverley Secondary College and completed VCE in 2020. I completed Software Development as a subject which further motivated me to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at RMIT.

							<p>My name is Ron Shi, and I am a 20-year-old university studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT. My parents are both Chinese, however I was born and raised here in Australia. I graduated high school in 2018 and studied science at Monash for 2 years before transferring. I primarily speak English, but I can also speak a conversational amount of Mandarin. I play games, mainly CS:GO and Fortnite, in my free time. Some other things I do in my spare time are watch movies, shows and anime, play basketball for a club and I occasionally enjoy editing photos and videos. I also have a pet beagle called Arrow.</p>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Angelo Alaan</h2>
							

							<p>I am 18 years old, born in Australia and have never gone overseas. I graduated from Gladstone Park Secondary College, and am a first year at RMIT University studying Bachelor of IT. I come from a Filipino background, but I can only speak English. Since I was in primary school, I have had an interest in IT, when I first used my dad's computer. My hobbies are playing games and hanging out with friends. I also have a cat named Kimi that I recently adopted.</p>

							<h2>Test Results</h2>
							<br>


							<h2 class="nametitle">Naveen Satish Kumar</h2>
							
							<p>I believe that the test results suggest that I am an outgoing person that uses logic, reasoning, and thinking rather than feeling, emotions, and going out on a limb by making ‘gut-feel’ decisions. The test results indicate that I have an executive personality, which reflects my love for leadership and delegation to successfully achieve desired outcomes.  The tests also suggest that I am not as creative. This can help the team as I can take charge and help facilitate, it also ensures that the team knows my weaknesses such as being inflexible and therefore someone who is stronger in that area can help.</p>

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Stephen Horaitis</h2>
							
							<p>These results indicate that I am a more introverted person, which would mean that within a work group environment I would be less talkative when compared with an extravert. This result did not surprise me. There are a few potential weaknesses that have been highlighted such as being unsystematic, unpredictable, and easily stressed. I will need to consider these and try to address them. Everyone will have a different personality, background, and experiences. It is for such reasons that when forming a group, we need to make sure that there is a mix of different personalities, to have broader ideas regarding the project.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Nivain Perera</h2>
							
							<p>The results will help me when I am forming groups. A team in which everyone interacts and contributes their own ideas will benefit the whole group because everyone will be aware of the steps that will be taken to accomplish a task. I would also like the team members to have a plan when they are trying to finish a task; being organized would help each team member keep track of their progress and increase their work rate because they are being organized and taking steps to finish a task.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Ron Shi</h2>
							
							<p>With my results in mind, my personality seems to make me more suited toward being a team player, rather than a team leader. My results also show that I can work both in groups and alone, however when in a group I would take more of a backseat. The Big Five personalities test gave me a very high score in agreeableness, and this accurately reflects on how I have worked in groups in the past – others would delegate the work and I would just do as I needed. This is probably a good choice seeing how the Myer-Briggs test gave me a 74% in prospecting, meaning I am more inclined to figuring things out as I go rather than plan the task at hand ahead of time and sticking to a schedule.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Angelo Alaan</h2>
							
							<p>These results show that in a team I would think logically but stick mostly on the observant side of the group as I am more introverted. However, I am not afraid to input on group discussions, I preferable would also follow someone else instead of being a leader in a group. I also learn better physically by doing instead of watching or reading. The results of one of the tests show that I have an extremely low imagination so I can be aided by someone who has a larger creativity and imagination than me.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Naveen Satish Kumar</h2>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>This job would include working with the Google TV product team to improve the user experience through designing technology, implementing new features, and improving the use of these technologies and features. This position would involve the collection and analysis of data which would then help in the design and improvement of user experience. This position is extremely appealing to me as I love research and technology, as well as helping people by improving services. This job would allow me to be creative as well as logical in making decisions that at the need of the day, will improve the overall user experience.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>This position requires the applicant to have completed a bachelor’s degree in an applicable discipline, have 5 years of relevant experience in work with focusses on analysis, have database query experience such as SQL, and have tangible experience in analyzing data and problem solving. In addition to this, preferred tertiary qualifications for this role include Master of Science (MS), Master of Business Administration (MBA), or other advanced degrees and qualifications in a relevant field. Experience with relational database such as SQL queries and use of reporting tools such as Data Studio is preferred.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>While studying at RMIT and building on my skills in programming, SQL, database, business analysis, design, and information management, etc. I will actively be looking for opportunities to gain 5 years of experience in an analytical role. I will also search for an undergraduate position which will further my skills and provide the experience needed for the job. If I am still not qualified enough, I will complete a master’s in information technology, helping my chances of getting the position.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2 class="nametitle">Stephen Horaitis</h2>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>A solution architect’s job is to create a design for applications or systems within an organization. According to my personality traits, I tend to be independent and creative. Therefore, I believe that this type of role would better suit my personality. I would be able to create designs based on my vision, as opposed to working as a developer who merely creates based on another’s ideas.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>Currently, whilst I have to an extent, the skills in terms of my ability to communicate, discipline, teamwork, perseverance, and problem solving, I still lack significantly in these areas. Furthermore, I am completely new to learning the tools required within this field. The closest I have come to learning how to work with anything technology related was in my year 10 programming class, in which we were briefly taught how to use the program “Scratch”. Therefore, I recognize that I have no usable skills in technology currently, but I am here to learn! The skills required for this particular position include: Many years of experience working within the IT industry. Exceptional communication skills. Enhanced analytical skills. Documentation and technical writing skills. Ability to interpret business requirements into technology solutions. Relevant IT qualifications.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>Upon completing my Bachelor of Information Technology, I will begin by starting off in a developer role, and over time, complete numerous certifications such as the AWS Solutions Architect certification (Amazon Web Services 2020, para. 6) but also, the equivalent Microsoft credentials like “Azure Solutions Architect Expert” certificate (Krasny 2021, para. 1). Furthermore, as I progress, I will take part in role-based industry training and lastly obtain a mentor for insight regarding the occupation of being a solutions architect. Lastly, I will engage in self learning using applications such as Pluralsight to enhance my skills and “adopt new tools” (Pluralsight 2020, para. 1).</p>

							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence may be influential in the field of technology because it can transform the way we communicate with everyday things. This work post by Elida is appealing because it addresses Artificial Intelligence. Elida also makes use of their technology to support charity; their emphasis on supporting people in need stands out to me because they have the potential to use cutting-edge technology to improve the lives of those who do not have access to modern technology. Elida also emphasizes the importance of working in a team environment, this appeals to me because sharing and exchanging ideas in a group setting can be a more productive way to accomplish a task.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>To be successful at Elida, the company expects certain skills such as knowledge of Microservices and Serverless software architecture. Cloud computing experience is needed. Having sufficient experience with modern SDLC and CI/CD pipelines, as well as previous experience designing backends for commercial-grade distributed applications. Elida also prefers someone who has worked with various cloud computing platforms, such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure. Someone with Node or Python experience is also preferred by the business.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>I have some Python experience, but I am eager to learn the skills required for this role. I plan to enrol in a Microsoft Azure course that will equip me with the requisite skills and knowledge to comprehend cloud computing. I believe that learning Python at RMIT would provide me with sufficient programming knowledge, but I am also willing to take a Node or Python course outside of RMIT to further my knowledge. To gain experience with SDLC and CI/CD pipelines, I can enrol in an Udemy online course that covers all of the required components for SDLC and CI/CD pipeline use.</p>

							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Elements Of The Job</h2>
							<p>A Cyber Security Analyst is responsible for protecting a company's network and systems from cyber-attacks. I am interest in security online in aspects of both defending and attacking. As once someone becomes familiar with the internet a whole range of options and information is opened to the user.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Skills Of The Job</h2>
							<p>Being a cyber security analyst requires: a bachelor’s in computer science, programming, or software engineering which I am currently not in, hoping to be able to switch into. Security analysts require a huge IT knowledge from cybersecurity laws to computer techniques, they also need to be analytical, detailed, communicative, and creative which I am still largely lacking in.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2 class="idealjobtitle">Career Plan</h2>
							<p>When finishing my bachelor of IT, I am hoping to get into a postgrad for Cyber security, potentially part-time whilst interning at Australia Post in which I current work at. I plan to keep on developing my programming skills specifically: Java, Python and HTML as I am interested in learning how to attack to develop my IT knowledge in knowing how to defend.</p>

								<br>
								<br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">3) HAVING LOOKED AT THE BURNING GLASS DATA, HAS YOUR OPINION OF YOUR IDEAL JOB CHANGED? WHY OR WHY NOT?</h2>
								<p>Naveen: Personally, my opinion of my ideal job has only gone greater. This is because the data suggests that the requirements and skills needed for my ideal job are in high demand by employers which will help me develop and further my progression in the IT industry in the future. For example, in my ideal job one of the major IT-specific skill they were after was SQL and this was the number one it-specific skill employers were in demand for according to burning glass.</p>
								<p>Stephen: In terms of whether my opinion of my ideal job has changed, I would have to say that currently, it has not.  This is due to a few reasons.  First, upon looking over the Burning Glass data sets, it is evident that my initial ideal job is rated as the highest in demand (987).  This then means that it will be much easier and more likely for me to receive a job in this field.</p>
								<p>Ron: Aside from SQL, the general and IT skills required for my ideal job are like the skills that many employees look for. I still believe that the position of a game developer is something that I am passionate about, and it will be a job that I will find fulfilling. It will be helpful however if I am unable to get my ideal job, that so many skills I have developed at that point are very transferrable among the IT industry.</p>
								<p>Angelo:  After discovering the burning glass data I have become interested in SQL as it is a large skill in demand, I have also discovered that I need to work on my communication skills which I have stated were lacking, as it is another extremely demanded skill. Furthermore, I have become less interested in Python and more curious about Java as JavaScript and JAVA seem to be important for an IT employees' skills.</p>
							  <p>Nivain:  My opinion on my ideal job has certainly changed, it made me realize the importance of acquiring and applying skills such as JavaScript in the role of a Senior Systems Engineer. Furthermore, Senior Systems Engineer is categorized under the top titles by Burning Glass which highlights the importance of using my skills acquired from the course at RMIT and applying these skills to earn a placement at a job under the position of a Senior Systems Engineer.</p>

 						 	<h2 class="nametitle">Cybersecurity</h2>
 						  	<p>
							The internet is like the sun, as the internet expands more problems and exploits are prevalent in recent society. But cybersecurity prevents those problems and exploits and includes the “measures used to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and information.” (ACSC 2021, Glossary) It is important to be secure online as several threats are prevalent and lurking, these threats include: illegal crypto-mining, data spillage, DoS (Denial of service attacks), Hacking, Identify theft, Malicious insiders, Malware, Phishing, Ransomware, Scams and Web shell malware (ACSC 2021). As technology keeps advancing, new methods of security breaches appear. However, cybersecurity is still seeing an increase in demand and attacks are decreasing, according to Accenture “The total number of cyberattacks dropped 11 percent, from 232 to 206 targeted attacks.” (Accenture 2021, The basics seem better) The decrease of cyberattacks is also shown through “a larger drop of 27 percent in the number of security breaches which indicates the basics seem to be improving”. (Accenture 2021, The basics seem better). Despite this in 2019 “68% of business leaders [still] feel their cybersecurity risks are increasing” (Accenture 2019, New risks from innovation and growth). However Cybersecurity is a risk not limited to businesses, “A survey by the AIC found that identity crime 1 in 4 Australians have been a victim of identity crime at some point in their lives” (Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, 2021) and 68% of the victims have not reported the misuse of their information, this means that 17% of the Australian population has had their personal information misused without reporting it at all this is largely due to the lack of knowledge users have of cybersecurity, the AIC stated that 25.1% of the cases police did not do anything, 12.6% were too embarrassed to report it, 19.3% don’t know where to report it and 12.5% did not know that identify theft was a crime. According to the AIC only 32% of reports were accepted, despite each victim spending an average of 34 hours repairing the damage caused by identify theft. (AIC, 2021). And this is only one of the listed cyber-crimes above.

							<p>
							And still despite this another huge presence is being developed, quantum computers, quantum computers have the potential to change the entire structure of the internet itself. Quantum computing overpowers classical computers as it utilizes qubits, whereas classic computers only use ones and zeros, qubits have a ‘superposition’ state that allows them to be a one and a zero. Allowing two qubits to represent four scenarios at the same time. (Brandmark, 2021) To put it in perspective Google’s Sycamore quantum processor calculated one million measurements on a quantum circuit, which took around 200s, which a state-of-the-art supercomputer would take 10,000 years to complete. (Physics world 2019, para. 4) Based on the processing speed of the quantum chips, both security and threat wise cybersecurity could be changed immensely. However, quantum computers are still far from becoming a possibility as problems such as quantum decoherence which comes from “aspects of the environment: changing magnetic and electric fields, radiation from warm objects, or cross talk between qubits” (Scientific American 2020, para. 3). Nonetheless IBM (International business Machines corporation) has still promised to develop numerous quantum computers over the next few years coming from the ‘Falcon’ – 27 qubits 2019, ‘Hummingbird’ – 65 qubits 2020, ‘Eagle’ – 127 qubits 2021, ‘Osprey’ – 433 qubits 2022 and ‘Condor’ – 1121 qubits in 2023. (See Figure 1)

							<p>
							A prime example of the importance of cyber security is quantum computing poses as it poses huge impact on cryptography, and in turn affects the crypto mining market heavily. For example, Bitcoin is a system for transferring value, a Bitcoin user is responsible for generating their own random address, and the user’s computer generates a random secret address that is required to transfer Bitcoin. (Deloitte, 2021) However a user with a quantum computer with access to another user’s public key could easily forge the private key and spend their Bitcoin which poses a huge problem for the crypto community. However, Quantum computers are not only threating crypto users but also the encryption and security of everyone on the internet is being threatened especially any type of asymmetric key pairs. Just Like how a quantum computer can crack a Bitcoin users private key, quantum computers can easily brute force and crack a password that uses factorization and prime numbers (havened, 2017) in 1 hour which would take a classic computer 78 million hours to do. It was also estimated that only 120 quantum computers were needed to disrupt every HTTPS connection in 2 seconds in 2017. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Cyber-security goes hand in hand with the advancement of technology and as technology keeps advancing so will the jobs related to it. Australia’s cyber security growth network sates that the government has spent 9% more per year and employed 4000 workers per year since 2017. The ASCS found that “90% of Australian organizations faced some form of attempted or successful cyber security compromise” (Seek 2021, para. 1). Cybersecurity affects everything and everyone online ensuring that companies, governments and individual’s information is kept private and secure. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Cybersecurity is an important part of everyone’s life, just as people lock their houses and cars to file cabinets and safes, they should lock their phones and information online, almost all information nowadays has an online copy, and an insecure lock could lead to a leak in information. Cybersecurity is prevalent is everyone’s daily lifestyle as users unlock their phones and computers, they also login to websites and applications posing way more information to be kept secret and as more information needs to be secured a large demand in cybersecurity employment for me as an individual is a welcome opportunity as it creates more positions in my ideal job. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Cybersecurity also creates an opportunity for more efficient data protection than physical security with thousands of “hidden” locks to be created to protect sensitive data. This affects everyone online as anyone who has access to a computer can encrypt and secure data to prevent access to anyone else. Despite this however many do not protect their online information as much as they should, which is portrayed through the massive identity thieving online. Myself, my family and friends often share passwords to several services and unlike creating copies of a physical key or sharing even more sensitive information so they can access the service, it is much easier and safer to do. Cybersecurity has already become an essential part in modern society and therefore has already affected everyone around me, but the advancement in security will create a more secure, efficient and effective method of information encryption and security. 
							</p>

							<p>
							Overall cybersecurity nowadays is impossible to live without, as it would basically be living in a house with no doors and open windows, allowing strangers to pass in and out with no protection at all. And as services such as TLS keep improving to prevent the threats of the advancement of technology such as quantum computers, cybersecurity is an essential part of IT Technology.
